.TH BEAGREP-QUERY "1" "July 2008" "beagrep" "Linux User's Manual"
.SH NAME
beagrep-query \- search your personal information space
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B beagrep-query
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIquery\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR beagrep-query
is used to search your personal information space via Beagrep, on the command
line.  It is a command-line form of the beagrep-search GNOME program.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS Search options
.TP
.B --max-hits
Reduce the number of search results returned per backend. The default is 100.
Increasing this will slow down overall search speed.
.TP
.B --verbose 
Print detailed information about each hit.
.TP
.B --cache
Show the entire cached text for each result. Only works with \fI--verbose\fR.
.br
Note that for large documents this will produce extremely large output,
so use this with uri queries or queries returning only a few results
Not recommended for live-queries or stats-only queries.
.TP
.B --live-query 
Enable live queries. This argument keeps beagrep-query running, continuously
feeding new matching hits as the system gets aware of them.
.TP
.B --stats-only
Show only statistics on the number of search results and how long it took to
get them, and not the results themselves.
.SS Other options
.TP
.B --keywords
Lists the keywords allowed in \fIquery\fR. Keyword queries can be specified as
.I keywordname:value e.g. ext:jpg
.TP
.B --help
Print the usage message.
.TP
.B --version
Print the version information.
.SH QUERY
You can query for a word, several words or a quoted phrase. When several words
are searched, only documents which contain all the words are matched. To specify
a phrase, enclose it in shell-escaped quotes (\\"search term\\").
.PP
Besides these beagrep supports an advanced query syntax. See http://beagrep-project.org/Searching_Data#Search_Syntax for more information.
